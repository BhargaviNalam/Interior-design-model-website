            <h3 style="color: azure;" class="f">Traditional country houses, with their timeless charm, often showcase
                regional architectural
                styles and materials. For example, English country houses may feature brick or stone with steeply
                pitched roofs and
                dormer windows, while French ones use local stone or stucco and incorporate rustic elegance. Interiors
                commonly
                highlight natural materials like wood and stone, with cozy, vintage-inspired decor. Landscaping
                typically includes
                extensive gardens and practical outbuildings, such as barns or sheds. These homes reflect historical
                periods and local
                resources, blending historical charm with modern adaptations to maintain their allure.

            <h3 style="color: azure;" class="f">A hill house is a type of residence strategically positioned on a
                hillside to maximize views and natural light while
                minimizing environmental impact. these homes often
                feature terraced
                levels, large windows, and overhangs to capitalize on panoramic vistas and create a sense of openness.
                The construction
                may incorporate materials like stone or timber, integrating with the natural surroundings. Interior layouts are typically open and fluid, often with multiple levels that follow
                the contours of
                the hill,  decks that extend the living area into the
                landscape. </h3>

            <h3 style="color: azure;" class="f">Cedar Haven houses are celebrated for their harmonious blend with
                nature, characterized by the
                prominent use of cedar wood in both structural and aesthetic elements. These homes typically feature
                warm, natural tones
                and textures, with cedar siding and shingles that weather gracefully over time. The design often
                emphasizes open, airy
                interiors with large windows that frame picturesque views and invite abundant natural light. Cedar Haven
                houses are
                designed to integrate seamlessly with their surroundings, and
                prioritize sustainability and energy efficiency. </h3>
